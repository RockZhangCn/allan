When I try to write a simple asynchronous dns query module base on adns probject,
I found there is no basic code on my hand which could help me embark on this idea
quickly.

So some basic code exists here!

First, I should express thanks to ChenShuo, many ideas were learned from his open source
project Muduo! Thanks very much!

Second, this is just a start! 

# adns-client
